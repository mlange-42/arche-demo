# Arche Demo -- Bee Hives

A stylized model of bee foraging and scouting.

Bees scout, forage, return to the hive and potentially do the waggle dance.
Other bees in the hive may fly to a patch indicated by a waggle dance,
or go scouting on their own.

Uses different components to indicate the different activities.
Hive internal decision making uses Arche's entity relations feature.
