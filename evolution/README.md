# Arche Demo &ndash; Evolution

An evolutionary model of grazer behavior.

Grazers have genes for 4 traits:  
 - `MaxAngle` is the maximum turning angle,
 - `MinGrass` is the grass threshold to stop grazing and start searching,
 - `Investment` is the energy invested in offspring,
 - `Offspring` is the number of offspring.

Colors of grazers are also inherited and mutated, but have no influence on fitness.
Grazers can only mate with other grazers with a similar color.

See the [live demo](https://mlange-42.github.io/arche-demo/evolution/) for this example.
