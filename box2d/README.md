# Arche Demo -- Box2D

A simulation using the [Go port](https://github.com/ByteArena/box2d) of [Box2D](https://box2d.org/), a 2D physics engine for games.

Here, [Arche](https://github.com/mlange-42/arche) only handles the graphics
and applies forces from the mouse.

See the [live demo](https://mlange-42.github.io/arche-demo/box2d/) for this example.
