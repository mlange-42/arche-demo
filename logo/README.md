# Arche Demo

The demo on the landing page of [Arche Demo](https://mlange-42.github.io/arche-demo/).

A simple simulation with 30.000 entities.

Each entity has a target pixel in the logo.
It accelerates towards this target, as well as away from the mouse pointer
in case it is within a certain distance.
